                   		<h2>What to buy?</h2>	
               		    	 <p>Too many people decide to start bicycling without really knowing what kind of bicycle they require. Don't be one of these people. <br>
Before you rush out to buy a new or used bicycle ask yourself these three question.
								<ul>
									<li>Where are you going to ride?</li>
									<li>Who will you be riding with?</li>
									<li>How do you want to ride and/or Is there a specific event that you need the bike to participate in?</li>
								</ul>

                       	<h2>Size Is Everything</h2>
                			<p>Too many people put price ahead of quality or need requirements. Your bike should fit your body as well as your favorite job interview suit. Many adult try to buy the $100 bike because that is all they have every had as children or all they want to spend. But if you weigh more than a teenager or of a particularly large or tall build you will find that inexpensive bikes will not last verylong before they beging to fail. Your bike should be engineered to hold someone your size for maximum enjoyment and safety.</p>
