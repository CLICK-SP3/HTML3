				<h1>Bicycling on a Budget</h1>
				
				<p>You don't have to spend alot of money to have a good time. If you take your time there are always <em>quality</em> products to be found on <br>gently used and like new bicycling equipment. You may even save &#189; or more than what you can find at a resale shop.

                   		<h2>What to buy?</h2>	
               		    	 <p>Too many people decide to start bicycling without really knowing <b> <a href="#one" title="bike"> what kind of bicycle</a></b> they require. Don't be one of these people. <br>
Before you rush out to buy a new or used bicycle ask yourself these three question.
								<ul> 
									<li>Where are you going to ride?</li>
									<li>Who will you be riding with?</li>
									<li>How do you want to ride and/or Is there a specific event that you need the bike to participate in?</li>
								</ul>

                       	<h2>Size Is Everything</h2>
                			<p>Too many people put price ahead of quality or need requirements. Your bike should fit your body as well as your favorite job <br>
							interview suit. Many adult try to buy the $100 bike because that is all they have every had as children or all they want to spend. <br>
							But if you weigh more than a teenager or of a particularly large or tall build you will find that inexpensive bikes will not last <br>
							verylong before they beging to fail. Your bike should be engineered to hold someone your size for maximum enjoyment and safety.</p>

							<dt>Road Bike</dt>
							<dd>Road bikes are for people that want to ride fast and far. <br>
								They have smaller tires and curled bars</dd>
						
							<dt>Hybrid Bike</dt>
								<dd>Hybrid bikes are great for commuting or light fitness. They are <br>
									lighter than MTBs but heavier than road bikes.They have flat handle bars<br>
									 that allow more comfort than road bikes. </dd>
							<dt>Mountain Bikes</dt>
								<dd>Mountain Bikes are also known as all-terrain bikes. They are built f<br>
								or off road use, so they will accel on terrain that is to uneven for bikes with <br>
								smaller tires. Because of the suspension components on the bike these bikes will <br>
								often weigh more than 28lbs.</dd>
							<dt>Crusier/Comfort Bikes</dt>
								<dd>Crusier/Comfort Bikes are what most people are familiar with. These bikes are <br>
								more comfortable to ride but due to the heavy weights of these bikes they are less <br>
								efficent for speed, distance, or even fitness.</dd>
