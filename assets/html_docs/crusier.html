                   		<h2>What to buy?</h2>	
               		    	 <p>Too many people decide to start bicycling without really knowing what kind of bicycle they require. Don't be one of these people. Before you rush out to buy a new or used bicycle ask yourself these three question.
								<ul>
									<li>Where are you going to ride?</li>
									<li>Who will you be riding with?</li>
									<li>How do you want to ride and/or Is there a specific event that you need the bike to participate in?</li>
								</ul>
